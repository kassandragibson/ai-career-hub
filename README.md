### Testing Philosophy
Following TDD principles:
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📐 Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Define user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Test First**: Write comprehensive tests before implementation
3. **Minimal Implementation**: Write just enough code to pass tests
4. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining functionality
5. **Continuous Integration**: All tests must pass before deployment

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking for reliability
- **Component Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all features
- **Professional Styling**: Business-appropriate design and UX
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user feedback
